# Custom Phaser 3 Builds with Typescript.

This is a project template with support to custom phaser builds and typescript language. This includes the phaser source code, phaser main reference file and a webpack configurations to build the custom phaser.js.
This can then be referanced and used to build a phaser game using typescript lang.

## Building Phaser
All the phaser sources and configurations are in the folder named phaser.
..src                          : The phaser source code
..types                        : The type descriptions to phaser objects
..phaser-core.js               : The phaser objects reference file used to build custom phaser.js
..phaser.ts.bk                 : A helper .ts file for enabling the auto completion of phaser.js
..webpack.config.js            : Build configurations

Run the following script to build the custom phaser file.

npm run build-phaser

This will build the custome phaser file refering phaser-core.js and using the phaser/webpack.config.js into the lib folder. And also copy the phaser.ts.bk to lib/phaser.ts. This file can be referenced by any typescript file in the game folder for importing phaser along with auto completion.

Update the phaser-core.js file to minimize the phaser.js lib build size by removing the un used items.

## Running the game in development mode
The game is run in development mode using a node http server. The webpack configurations for running the game in development mode is in the file named webpack.config-ts-dev.js. This file is referenced by the addDevMiddlewares.js to create and run a webpack-dev-middleware and webpack-hot-middleware plugin. Hence whenever there is a change in any file the build is called and changes are reflected in the browser.

There is also included a addProdMiddleware.js file. This can be upgraded according to the needs if you want to host a node http server and run this application.

## Building the game
All the game logics are added in the game folder.
..assets                       : All the game assets (dynamic loaded using Phaser.Loader) like images, fonts and audio files. This folder will be copied to the build
..scenes                       : All the game scenes
..game.ts                      : This is where the game is configured and instance is created.
..index.html                   : The main html file
..index.ts                     : Starting point of the game. This is where the logics to start the game is like the (body.onload event) is added.
..logger.ts                    : A simplified styled logger for game.

Run the following script to build the game.

npm run build-ts

This will build the game in production mode and add all the files to the dist folder. This will also copy the assets filder to the dist folder.
